# Permutation tests: A modern, superior alternative to the two-sample t-test?

## Research topic and (provisional) research question:
The two-sample t-test is arguably the most used analysis method in psychology. As you have learned, it
comes with three central assumptions: Independence, Normality, and Homogeneity. If these
assumptions are met, the t-test correctly controls the type I error rate and also has the lowest type II
error rate (among all tests that correctly control the type I error rate). Thus, in this case it can be
considered an optimal test. However, the situation is less obvious in the case of a violation of these
assumptions, which in psychology is arguably always the case. In this project, we will perform simulation
studies to investigate in which situations an alternative test procedure based on the permutation
method (and possibly robust estimation) outperforms the two-sample t-test.

## Research method:
We will use simulation studies as our main research method. We will perform these simulation studies
using the statistical programming language R. To enable you do to this, an R course will be provided.
